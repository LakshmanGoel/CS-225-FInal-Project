Our code was able to produce the shortest distance between the most popular airports of two countries as selected by the user, and was therefore able to answer our leading question. As an example we ran our code for the source country to be India and destination country to be Pakistan. We found out that the most popular airport in India was Sardar Vallabhbhai Airport, Ahmedabad and the same in Pakistan was an airport in Faisalabad. Dijkstra's tells us that we go from Ahmedabad to Mumbai, to Karachi and then finally Faisalabad, which is the shortest distance path we were looking for.

Running Instructions - In the terminal write - ./flights \"First_country's_name\" \"Second_country's_name\"
Important: In case of writing countries, if the country name has a whitespace, replace that space an underscore.

Output and correctness of the algorithms:
We tested each algorithm through our own test cases, taking into account a smaller sampling of airports. In the smaller sampling of airports, we knew what the results of the algorithms would be, so if our algorithms matched our expected results, we knew the algorithm was correct.

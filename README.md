# CS-225-Final-Project
GitHub repository for the final project. (Spring 2023 Semester) Team members: Lakshman Goel, Adarsh Payyavula, Achintya Mohan

Our code was able to produce the shortest distance between the most popular airports of two countries as selected by the user, and was therefore able to answer our leading question.

Running Instructions - In the terminal write - ./flights \"First_country's_name\" \"Second_country's_name\"
Important: In case of writing countries, if the country name has a whitespace, replace that space an underscore.

Output and correctness of the algorithms:
We tested each algorithm through our own test cases, taking into account a smaller sampling of airports. In the smaller sampling of airports, we knew what the results of the algorithms would be, so if our algorithms matched our expected results, we knew the algorithm was correct.
